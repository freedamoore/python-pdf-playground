## A project where I'm trying different ways to manipulate PDF files using python and the PyPDF2 library.

#### You need to install python, pip3 and then use pip install PyPDF2 to install the library.

So far I've implemented:

* rotating a file and saving it under a different name
* combining two or more files
* watermarking every page of a pdf document

Comment and uncomment the parts you want to run accordingly. I've included the command you need to run in the comments.
